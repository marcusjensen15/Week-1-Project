      <h2 class="jumbotron">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi Everyone! My name is Marcus Jensen, thank you for visiting my Webpage. I am a born and raised Oregonian (my mom always jokes that we are 2 of the 5 people living in Oregon who were actually born here). I came to the program having done some pre-work surrounding HTML, CSS and Computer Programing in general. With Epicodus, I’m hoping to: strengthen my coding skills, meet an awesome network of people, and be the best developer I can possibly be. Please scroll down to learn a bit more about me, and my previous experiences!
      </p>
      <h2 class="jumbotron">Work Experience</h2>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Zapproved</h3>
        <h4>Positions Held:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Sales Development Representative</li>
          <li>Enterprise Business Representative</li>
          <li>Inside Sales Representative</li>
        </ol>

        <p>At Zapproved, I began as a Sales Development Representative. In this position, it was my responsibility to follow up on inbound leads that had been generated by marketing efforts. I was quickly promoted out of that role to an Enterprise Business Representative. In this position I outbound prospected key decision makers within our strategic account territory, and set meetings for the Account Executive Team. My next role, Inside Sales Representative is responsible for fielding these meetings for further qualification. </p>

        <h3>AskNicely</h3>
        <h4>Position: Account Executive</h4>
        <p>At AskNicely, I was responsible for running the full sales cycle from initial meeting, to closed deal. In this position I learned all about: the full sales funnel, framing our product as the obvious choice over our competition, and engaging the appropriate parties on the buyer side to get the deal closed. </p>

      <h2 class="jumbotron">Education</h2>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Copenhagen Business School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <span class="education">Summer Program 2013</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I decided to participate in a summer course during my time at UO in Copenhagen. This summer’s curriculum was heavily focused on entrepreneurship. It was a lot of fun to study business in a different part of the world and meet new friends from different countries!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>University of Oregon</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <span class="education">Class of 2014</span></li>
                <li>Major in Business Administration</li>
                <li>Minor in Computer Science</li>

          </ul>

        <p>At the U of O, my studies were heavily focused in the area of Business. Mid-way through my junior year, I discovered my passion for coding and the infinite potential it held, so I decided to pick up that minor. I was also heavily involved in student life and extracurricular activities outside of my classwork. </p>

      <h2 class="jumbotron">Why Programming?</h2>
      <p class="programming-text">I’m a big believer that the most successful people in the world are interdisciplinary. My ultimate goal is to start a SAAS business. In my opinion, to be an excellent founder you need to bring some key skills to the table. The two most important skills when starting a software company are: knowing how to sell, and knowing how to code. I’ve spent the last five years learning how SAAS software is bought and sold, and in my free time have tinkered with building it. I look forward to buckling down and getting good at writing software! </p>
