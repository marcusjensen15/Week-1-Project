          <li>Inside Sales Representative</li>
        </ol>

        <p>At Zapproved, I began as a Sales Development Representative. In this position, it was my responsibility to follow up on inbound leads that had been generated by marketing efforts. I was quickly promoted out of that role to an Enterprise Business Representative. In this position I outbound prospected key decision makers within our strategic account territory, and set meetings for the Account Executive Team. My next role, Inside Sales Representative is responsible for fielding these meetings for further qualification. </p>

In this position I learned all about: the full sales funnel, framing our product as the obvious choice over our competition, and engaging the appropriate parties on the buyer side to get the deal closed. </p>
